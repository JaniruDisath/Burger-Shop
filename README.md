## 📖 About the Project
**Burger Shop** is my very first long term Java project.  
It started as a simple console application using arrays and has grown into multiple versions 
applying **OOP, Swing UI, layered architecture, SOLID principles, and database integration**.  

This repository is not just about a single app, but about **showcasing my growth as a developer** and my ability to **refactor, redesign, and expand software over time**.
