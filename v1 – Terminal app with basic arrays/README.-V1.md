# 🍔 Burger Shop – Version 1

This was my **first attempt** at creating a structured project in Java.  
Initially built with simple arrays and text file saving, I later revisited it to improve and apply new concepts.

## ⚙️ Features
- Store burger data in arrays  
- Save and load orders using text files  
- Basic console-based interaction  

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Learned how to manage arrays for data storage  
- Realized the limits of procedural-style coding  

## 🔄 Updates
- **v1.0.0** – Original implementation (arrays, text files)  
- **v1.1.0* – Convert array storage into object arrays  

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Applying SOLID principles  
- Applying layered architecture
